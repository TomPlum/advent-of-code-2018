# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code (2018)

## What is Advent of Code?

_Excerpt from the Advent of Code [website](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about);_

    "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
    and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a
    speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or
    to challenge each other."

## About
